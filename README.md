# CONCRETE-IDENTIFICATION-OF-EMAIL-PHISHING-ATTACKS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS

This project is a Python-based phishing email detection system developed as part of a Final Year Project. The system applies machine learning techniques to classify emails as phishing or legitimate based on textual features.

## Project Overview
The system performs text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and classification using several machine learning models. The models used in this project include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). A hybrid model combining multiple classifiers is also implemented to improve detection performance.

## Machine Learning Techniques Used
- Naive Bayes (NB)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)  
- Hybrid ensemble-based classification  

## Project Structure
- `Phishing_Detection.py` – Main application logic for phishing detection  
- `train_models.py` – Model training and saving logic  
- `pages/` – Supporting Python scripts for application workflow  
- `.streamlit/` – Streamlit configuration files  

Trained models, datasets, and experimental results are provided separately via Google Drive.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Streamlit  

## Notes
This repository contains source code only. Large files such as datasets and trained machine learning models are excluded and submitted separately as part of the project prototype.
